# MyArena Support

Welcome to the MyArena Support page! We’re here to help you turn your vision into reality. If you encounter any issues or have questions, please reach out:

## Troubleshooting

1. **App Crashes or Won’t Launch**  
   - Make sure you’re on the latest iOS version (iOS 17 or later).  
   - Force-quit the app and relaunch.  
   - Reboot your device.  
   - If the problem persists, send us the crash log via email.

2. **Location or Map Issues**  
   - Verify “MyArena” has location permission in **Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services**.  
   - Make sure you have a good GPS signal (stay outdoors or near a window).  
   - Toggle Location Services off/on and restart the app.

3. **Subscription & Premium**  
   - If you’ve purchased Premium but it’s not unlocked, go to the **Profile** tab and tap **Restore Purchases**.

   - Contact support with your receipt if restoration fails.
